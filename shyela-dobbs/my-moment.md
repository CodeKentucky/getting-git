# My breakthrough moment

A sentence or two about a moment throughout Code Kentucky where you had an aha moment. 

When I was working on my work-along project I struggled to get theh hamburger menu to work properly through my script.js paged linked in my HTML. I had used a couple different wordings.I finally watched different JS video that mentioned referencing the script tag within the body tag, rather than in the head tag....WHICH WORKED. It took more days than I am willing to admit; but I now have a hamburger menu button for my small screens.
