# My breakthrough moment

I got here! That is the aha moment most recently.

What stands out the most is the prework and the course that had to be completed was not functioning.  I was ready to quit but with my trouble shooting skills I went with copy and paste the code that I knew was correct out to a differnt file, restart the video, paste my work back in and it would be successful.
