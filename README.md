# Getting Git 

Hello all, the purpose of this repository is to help us explore and get hands on experience using Git and GitHub. This repository is focused around markdown. The logic behind this is that taking code out of the equation, we can see how git is working with our files by using sentences and paragraphs. 

### Markdown references 
* https://commonmark.org/help/
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown
* https://www.markdownguide.org/


## Over the next few steps we will..
* Clone this git repository.
* Refresher on branching strategy, for your projects and in the industry. 
* Use common command line tools to create folders and files.
* write a markdown file.
* Push changes to github.
* Learn about pull requests/merge requests & merging code in general. 


## Steps 

1) Clone this git repository.

``` shell
git clone git@github.com:andrewnoble94/getting-git.git

```

2) Create a branch 

``` shell

## Create a branch inside the repository using the following convention update/<name>-moment

git checkout -b update/andrews-moment

```

3) Use common command tools to create folders and files.

``` shell
##From directory from which you cloned this repository, create a new directory with the following naming convention. getting-git/<name>

mkdir andrew-noble

## By this point you will have cloned the repository and created a folder within the repository. Now lets create a file in our new folder, we will use the touch command for this. 

touch my-moment.md

```

4) write a markdown file.

> Using your preferred text editor, open up your newly created markdown file. In that file write the following. 

``` markdown
# My breakthrough moment

A sentence or two about a moment throughout Code Kentucky where you had an aha moment. 

```

5) Push your changes to GitHub

> After you've written your file, commit it and prepare to push it to github. With this newly created branch, your git will probably give you an error when you try to push. This is git telling you that it needs remote tracking information for your newly created branch. Git will return the command that is needed to set up remote tracking.

> For the next steps of this exercise, we will be using the Github UI to learn about merging code and pull requests.
