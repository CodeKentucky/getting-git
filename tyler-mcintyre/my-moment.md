My moment was at work where I was making a website for a teachback program.
I had three or four different notepads open and another for a browser I was
using to look up how do do certain things. Everything was fun; I loved learning
how to do new things and seeing how far I could take those ideas on my own before
looking up how to do more. Then I realized that I was getting paid to do it
and just got super happy.
