# My breakthrough moment
I could not get my css file to style my html file on github pages. I was not careful to match case in my file path on my local machine. 

In my Index.html file I was referencing my css file in my css directory, but the directory was named using lower case. 

However, the directory on github the css directory was named using upper case. Once I matched the case my css was able to style my index.html file.
